# Heatmap

This sample app shows the concept of a heatmap renderer.

A Heatmap renders point features as a raster surface, emphasizing areas with a higher density of points along a continuous color ramp.

Heatmaps are created by setting a HeatmapRenderer instance to the renderer property of the layer. 

As an alternative, a static heatmaps allow you to persist the visual density's of a heatmap from one scale across all scale levels. As the user zooms in and out, the heatmap will consistently show the same hot spots in the view.
