# WebMap vs Code
This sample shows the power of a webmap in custom applications. The left map is build in code, the renderer of the featurelayer alone takes more than 170 lines of code. And it does not even have a working popup. 


The right map takes only 8 lines of code for the complete map. Including popups. This is because it is based on a webmap.
