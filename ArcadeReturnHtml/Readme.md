# Return HTML with Arcade
This sample shows how to use Arcade to create HTML content for the Popup.
<br/>
In this case Arcade is used to get points that intesect with a polygon, and create a link for each layer in the map. This can be used to for example trigger an Azure HTTPTrigger Function.
<br/>
<br/>
These are the steps that need to be taken in the MapViewer. Note: this doesn't work in the MapViewer Classic.
