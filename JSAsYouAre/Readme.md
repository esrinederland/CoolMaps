This sample shows how you can intergrate the ArcGIS API for JavaScript in your application, using your applications style.

![The JS and Topo RD sample](../images/JSAsYouAre.png)
The map is intergrated in the circle using CSS.<br/>

The basemap style is adapted to the colors of the style of the website using the map styler: https://apps.arcgisonline.nl/mapstyler/

The zoom in and out buttons are styled according the same style of the website

The attribution of the map is shown on the bottom of the website.
